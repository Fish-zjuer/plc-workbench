# FIFO First-In-First-Out Queue

- **Difficulty:** Hard (hard)

## Requirements

Write a function block FB implementing a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) circular queue. Derive the queue capacity and element type from the caller-supplied buffer.

1. Each rising edge of enqueue requests one enqueue operation. If the queue is not full, append the current item value to its tail.
2. Each rising edge of dequeue requests one dequeue operation. If the queue is not empty, remove its front element and write that value back to item. The caller must not request enqueue and dequeue in the same invocation.
3. When reset is TRUE, empty the queue and set elementCount to zero. Reset takes priority over enqueue and dequeue; stored buffer values need not be overwritten.
4. Output the current number of valid elements through elementCount. Zero means the queue is empty; a count equal to the actual buffer array length means it is full.
5. Reject a dequeue request on an empty queue or an enqueue request on a full queue. Leave the queue and item unchanged and report the reason through status.
6. The queue is empty on its first invocation. Define head and tail positions and other internal state within the implementation; do not expose them as interface parameters.

Status codes:

- 16#0000: No error in this invocation, including idle, reset and successful operations.
- 16#8001: The dequeue request was rejected because the queue is empty.
- 16#8002: The enqueue request was rejected because the queue is full.

## Interface Definition

| Direction | Variable/Field | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Input | `enqueue` | `BOOL` | Enqueue request; one operation per rising edge. |
| Input | `dequeue` | `BOOL` | Dequeue request; one operation per rising edge. |
| Input | `reset` | `BOOL` | TRUE resets the queue to empty; takes priority over enqueue and dequeue. |
| Output | `elementCount` | `DINT` | Current number of valid elements, from zero through the queue capacity. |
| Output | `status` | `WORD` | Invocation status: 16#0000 no error, 16#8001 dequeue from an empty queue, 16#8002 enqueue into a full queue. |
| Input/Output | `item` | `VARIANT` | Mutable scalar reference: read its value when enqueuing; write the removed front value on successful dequeue. Its concrete type must match the array element type. |
| Input/Output | `buffer` | `VARIANT` | Reference to a nonempty one-dimensional array with a single concrete element type, used as queue storage. Capacity is the actual array length. |

Associate buffer with a nonempty, homogeneous one-dimensional array and item with a writable scalar of the same element type. Keep the buffer association fixed for each function-block instance. Derive capacity from the actual array length; it must fit in a positive DINT.
